# DDM_Timeseries_Forecast

## Autoregressive Denoising Diffusion Models for Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series to benchmark datasets from different domains

### Installation

I tested execution of `examples/Time-Grad-Electricity.ipynb` on Windows 10 with Python 3.6.8. Installed the dependencies from `requirements-pip.txt` using pip.

### Implemented TimeGradEstimator on following classes of dataset:-

- Medical : Hospital, Covid
- Environmental : Solar-energy
- Financial : fred_md(Macroeconomic Financial Variables)
- Neural Network Forecasting Competition: nn5_daily_with_missing
